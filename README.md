# ARP Attack Group Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to research different variations of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Attack and implement them using Docker cotnainers. The attacks that were looked into was Man in The Middle (MITM) attack, ARP flooding attack, and session hijacking attack.  

## Setup
As mentioned, these attacks were implemented in docker with a few important packages installed. The main package that was used was [scapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which was used to sniff traffic and craft packets to perform the attacks. 

## Contributions
I was responsible for researching and implementing the session hijacking attack. I also wrote the Background, Session Hijacking, and Conclusion sections of the project paper which can be found in this repository. The code that is cited in the paper can also be found in this repository.
